## Introduction
Our mission is to dive deep into global trends and uncover the story behind the surge in clean energy. Using real-world data, we will explore how economic, demographic, and environmental factors (like GDP, population, carbon emissions, and policy influence) shape energy production around the world.

We will try to answer the following questions:

**1. Which regions are investing the most efficiently in renewables? Which economic, environmental, and policy factors drive the success to renewable energy development?**

**2. If you are an investor interested in renewable energy (solar, wind power), which country would be your target?**

**3. What lessons can we learn to accelerate the green energy transition?**


## Project Executive Summary

**Europe** is leading the global renewable transition, with France, Germany, and especially the UK showing the highest impact. Over the past decade, these countries achieved renewable energy shares consistently above 50% of total electricity production in recent years. The UK stands out with a striking decline in CO₂ emissions during the past five years (despite a slight rebound in 2023).

The next wave of opportunity lies in high-potential but not yet fulfilled markets such as the **US (solar) and the UK (wind)**. Long-term success is not only resource-driven but also shaped by **policy, governance, and regulatory** framework.

##### Sector-specific Leaders
Solar power - Brazil.
Despite relatively low solar irradiance (resources), Brazil achieved the highest compound annual growth in installed solar capacity and leads in absolute production (GWh).

Wind power - France and India.
France shows long-term stability with >75k GW installed consistently. India, despite lower average wind speeds, has surged since 2021–22, signaling strong momentum.

Biomass power - China.
China dominates both absolute production and per-capita installed capacity growth (0.03%), outpacing competitors such as India.

Hydropower - Germany.
Second only to Brazil in total production who shows strong volatility and low growth rate, Germany maintains stable installed capacity with the highest relative growth rate (0.03%).

##### Success Factors

Policy & Governance - Proactive government policies and subsidies have driven Brazil, France, and Germany’s success.

Political Stability - Both Brazil and European leaders score high in stability, enabling consistent investment.

Regulatory Quality - Particularly strong in the UK, where energy market liberalization is progressing rapidly.

#### Investment Opportunities

Solar Power – United States.
The US has the world’s best natural conditions (highest solar irradiance) but underdeveloped installed capacity. Regulatory volatility has limited progress. With stronger policy support, the US could quickly emerge as a global leader.

Wind Power – United Kingdom.
Despite favorable wind conditions and excellent business environment (ease of doing business, regulatory quality, market liberalization), the UK has not yet fully capitalized on its potential. With additional government support, the UK presents a compelling growth opportunity.
